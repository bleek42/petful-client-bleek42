### Summary

An animal shelter web applicaton for cats and dogs. The adoption process here works strictly on a "First-In, First-Out" basis. The user can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but the user may only adopt the animal that has been here the longest. If the user wants to adopt a new pet, the user may add their name to the list. When it is the users turn, the user will be able to adopt the currently available pet.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
